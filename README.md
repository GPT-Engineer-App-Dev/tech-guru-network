# tech-guru-network

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called "Particles" for software talent specializing in web technologies. Include the following:

- A hero section that clearly explains the value proposition of the marketplace 
- A list of developers, showing their name, location, and the technologies they specialize in (as labels)
- Make the list filterable and searchable
- A call-to-action button to "Send a message" to a developer (but don't implement the actual messaging functionality yet)

Use a modern, professional design that will appeal to companies looking to hire software talent.
